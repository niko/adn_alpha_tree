Chrome extension: A tree view for app.net Alpha

This Chrome extension reorders posts in app.nets Alpha interface so that post threads are visible.

It only works for posts which are currently loaded. Posts are progressivly reordered when you scroll and more (parent) posts are loaded.

At the moment it only works for you own stream, not for the global streams.

At the moment it's only available here at github, not in the Chrome extension directory.

Installation
------------

Download and unzip. Go the [the Chrome extensions page](chrome://extensions/) and ensure that the "Developer Mode" checkbox is checked. Click "Load unpacked extensionâ€¦" to pop up a file-selection dialog and select the folder with the unzipped extension.
